# GCD - Euclid's Algorithms
Euclid's Algorithm is a simple one to find the ***gcd*** (greatest common divisor) ***between two non-negative, not-both-zreo numbers***.

This section is to understand the idea of an algorithms, as well as to practice writing psuedocode for the Euclid's algorithm to solve it ***Recursively and Iteratively***.
